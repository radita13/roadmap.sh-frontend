# Datepicker UI

## Project Description

In this project, I created a simple static Datepicker UI using only HTML and CSS. The primary goal was to design and style a calendar layout that mimics a datepicker interface, without adding any interactive functionality, which can be enhanced later with JavaScript. This project helped me practice positioning, layout, and styling techniques in CSS.

I focused on using fundamental CSS properties such as Flexbox, grid layouts, borders, and pseudo-elements to structure the components and achieve a clean and functional design. The project aimed to enhance my skills in building well-organized and visually appealing user interface elements.

## Resources Used

Below are some of the resources I utilized during this project:

1. **CSS Box Model**: Understanding the box model was essential for controlling the padding, margin, border, and size of elements.

2. **CSS Flexbox**: Used for the layout to create responsive and flexible designs, especially for aligning elements within the datepicker.

3. **CSS Pseudo-elements**: I used pseudo-elements like `::before` and `::after` to create the navigation arrows for the calendar.

4. **CSS Border & Backgrounds**: These properties were important for adding visual structure to the calendar, such as borders around dates and background styling.

5. **MDN CSS Display**: Learning the various values of `display`, such as `flex` and `grid`, helped in creating the layout for the calendar's days and months.
