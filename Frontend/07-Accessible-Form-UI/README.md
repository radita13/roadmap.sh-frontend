# Accessible Form UI

## Project Description

In this project, I created a simple **Form UI** using **HTML** and **CSS** only. The main goal of this project was to design and style a form interface that includes fields for **Full Name**, **Email**, **Password**, and **Confirm Password**, along with a button to toggle the visibility of the password text. Additionally, the form features a **progress bar** to indicate the completion level of the form and a checklist of requirements that must be met to achieve 100% completeness. While this version of the form is not functional, it serves as a static UI component that can later be enhanced with **JavaScript**.

This project helped me practice using **HTML** and **CSS** and focused on creating a **user-friendly** and **accessible** form for all users, including those with disabilities. I utilized basic CSS properties such as **Flexbox**, **Grid Layouts**, **Borders**, and **Pseudo-elements** to organize the form components and achieve a clean and functional design.

4. **CSS Pseudo-elements**: I used pseudo-elements like `::before` and `::after` to add extra elements like validation indicators or error messages.
