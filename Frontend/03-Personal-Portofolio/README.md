# Personal Portofolio

## Project Description
In this project, the previously created HTML website structure will be styled with a focus on using CSS to create a responsive layout, as well as applying colors and typography. The main goal is to ensure the website layout matches the mockup and looks good on various screen sizes, without worrying too much about design details like colors or backgrounds.
