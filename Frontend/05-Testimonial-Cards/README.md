# Testimonial Cards

## Project Description
In this project, I created a series of testimonial cards that showcase quotes or statements from satisfied customers or users. Each card is designed to enhance my skills in layout, positioning techniques, and typography using CSS. The primary focus was to create a clean and functional layout while maintaining an attractive and credible design.

The purpose of this project was to improve my ability to structure and style content using HTML and CSS. Completing this project allowed me to gain valuable experience in designing visually appealing and well-organized components.
