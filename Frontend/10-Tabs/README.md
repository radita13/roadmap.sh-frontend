# Tabs

## Project Description

This project aims to introduce the basics of DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript. It implements a simple tab functionality using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. The page consists of four tabs, with the first tab set as active by default. When a user clicks on another tab, the currently displayed content is hidden, and the selected tabâ€™s content is shown. Additionally, this project includes a slide animation effect for the content. Each time a different tab is clicked, its content appears with a sliding animation effect.
