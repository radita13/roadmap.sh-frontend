# Cookie Consent

## Project Description

This project aims to introduce the basics of DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript. It implements a cookie consent popup to inform users about the use of cookies and obtain their consent. The popup appears when the user visits the page, displaying a message and a button to accept consent. Once the user agrees, the popup disappears.  

Additionally, this project stores the user's consent using cookies or localStorage, ensuring that the popup does not appear on subsequent visits.
