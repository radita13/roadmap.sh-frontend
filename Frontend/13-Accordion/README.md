# Restricted Textarea

## Project Description

In this project, the accordion component displays a list of questions or titles. When a user clicks on a question, the corresponding answer or content expands, while the previously opened section automatically collapses. This ensures that only one section is open at a time, keeping the UI clean and well-organized. Additionally, the project is designed with a responsive layout to ensure optimal display across different devices.
